how to play game :-
**Simon** is a memory game that challenges players to repeat a sequence of flashing colors in the correct order. Here's how you play:

### 1. **Start the Game:**
   - Turn on the Simon game device (or start the game on your app/online version).
   - The game will begin by lighting up one of the colored buttons (typically red, yellow, green, or blue).

### 2. **Watch the Sequence:**
   - Simon will flash one color in a sequence. You need to remember that color and its position.

### 3. **Repeat the Sequence:**
   - After the initial flash, you’ll need to repeat the exact same sequence by pressing the colored buttons in the same order.
   - If you get it right, Simon will add another color to the sequence.

### 4. **Continue Playing:**
   - The sequence will grow longer with each round. Simon will flash the sequence again, and you’ll need to repeat it with the new addition.
   - Keep playing until you make a mistake.

### 5. **Game Over:**
   - If you press a button in the wrong order, the game ends, and Simon will typically make a sound to indicate you lost.
   - You can start a new round or try to beat your previous score.

### Tips for Success:
- **Stay calm and focus**: The longer the sequence, the harder it gets to remember. Focus on the colors, and try to keep track in your mind.
- **Chunk the sequence**: Break down the sequence into smaller chunks (like a phone number) to help remember it.
- **Practice**: As with any memory game, practice will improve your skills over time.

Have fun!
